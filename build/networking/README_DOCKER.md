# IPDK Container

## What is IPDK container?
The IPDK Container is a Virtual Networking Infrastructure Container and is
built with the following components:

1. [IPDK Networking-Recipe with P4 Support](https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe)
2. [P4_DPDK_target library](https://github.com/p4lang/p4-dpdk-target)
3. [P4-DPDK](https://github.com/DPDK/dpdk)
4. [P4C P4 reference compiler with DPDK, eBPF target support](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c)
5. TDI pipeline builder program
6. P4 Pipeline program examples

The IPDK container Dockerfile builds all the five components and their dependencies
and integrates them providing a P4 based virtual networking switch, P4
compiler + builder and example p4 pipeline code within the container. Following
sections decribe the steps on how to bring up and run this container and use
the example P4 pipeline programs.

## Install IPDK CLI

To fully use all the features of the IPDK containers and if you want to follow
the examples, then install the IPDK CLI with the following command executed
from the directory this README is found in:

 ```bash
 $ git clone https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk.git
 $ cd ipdk/build
 $ ./ipdk install
 ```

If your system has not added `~/.local/bin` or `~/bin` to your search PATH then
execute the given `export PATH=<>` command to add the `ipdk` command
to your current environment path each time you open a new terminal to your
system!

*NOTE*: If `$PATH` variable is not updated as mentioned above, use `./ipdk`
everywhere instead of using `ipdk` command directly.

The IPDK CLI is by default setup for a `Fedora:33` environment. Build
and run your IPDK container with the `ubuntu:20.04` or `ubuntu:18.04` base
environment by running `ipdk install ubuntu2004` or `ipdk install ubuntu1804`.
`ipdk install default` will bring you back to the default environment (fedora)

## Build Containers

The following are the container images you can build from here:

* Fedora 33 P4-DPDK networking container: `ipdk install fedora33`
* Ubuntu 18.04 P4-DPDK networking container: `ipdk install ubuntu1804`
* Ubuntu 20.04 P4-DPDK networking container: `ipdk install ubuntu2004`
* Ubuntu 20.04 eBPF networking container: `ipdk install ebpf-ubuntu2004`

## Container Build Instructions

## Section 1: Bring-up IPDK Container

### Pre-requisites to run IPDK container

* Docker is installed and running with correct (proxy) settings.
* Note: Since all dependent packages are installed in docker container, these
  specific settings should be defined on the host machine/server. Eg:
  * A nameserver in `resolv.conf`
  * proxies in below files if needed:
    - `~/.docker/config.json`(<https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/>)
    - `http-proxy.conf` under docker service.
    - /etc/default/docker
  * Then restart docker service.
* If you want to push the container to Docker Hub then login to docker using
  `docker login`
* Start docker service using following commands:

  ```command
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl restart docker
  ```

* If you are behind proxy update `PROXY` parameter in `scripts/ipdk_default.env` file.
  Example: `PROXY=http://iam.behind.proxy:1234`

Install the IPDK CLI and set your specific IPDK CLI configuration settings! See
[here](#CLI-configuration-settings) for more information about IPDK CLI
configuration file settings and inner workings!

* If you are behind a proxy, add the `PROXY=<your proxy address>` option to
  add your proxy to your user CLI configuration file.
* By default source code will not be retained in the IPDK container when built.
  If user wants to retain source code, set the (`KEEP_SOURCE_CODE=true`)
  option in the CLI configuration file.
* By default, image will contain all the modules including its dependencies.
  To minimize the image size suitable for K8S or any cloud deployments, set the
  (`DEPLOYMENT_IMAGE=true`) option in the CLI configuration file to keep only
  modules and libraries required for bringing up the stack.

* Set the location of the working directory for the logs, interfaces and
  example VM images by setting the `VOLUME=` option in your user CLI
  configuration file. Default location is `~/.ipdk/volume`

### Commands to bring-up IPDK container

* The following commands can be used to build a IPDK container:

  * Run `ipdk build --no-cache` - To build a IPDK docker image.
  * Run `ipdk build --no-cache --use-proxy` - To build a docker image while
    running behind a proxy (set the `PROXY` option, see above!!!).
  * Run `ipdk build` - To build a IPDK docker image with using
    previously cached build data.
  * Run `ipdk build --use-proxy` - To build a docker image while running
    behind a proxy, with using previous cached build's data. (set the
    `PROXY` option, see above!!!)

* In normal environments use `ipdk build --no-cache` Now the container image is
  built, this can take more then 60 minutes depending on the hardware/VM
  configuration.
* When the build is ready, the infrap4d switch can be started as docker
  container daemon with `ipdk start -d`. A `volume` directory will be created
  (depending on option settings at `~/.ipdk/volume`). This directory will be used
  for creating the vhost socket interfaces in `volume/intf`, all the log files in
  `volume/logs` and can be used to share files with the IPDK daemon container
  where the `VOLUME` directory is available as '/tmp'.
* Run `ipdk connect` - To connect to your IPDK container daemon and to use
  it from a command line.

If above commands are successful, at this point you should have your IPDK
container up and running, and should see the container prompt like below:

```text
    root@c5efb1a949ad ~]#
```

`c5efb1a949ad` is your container id as displayed in command `docker ps -a`


As your Infrap4d process should be up and running, you could see the infrap4d
process with the `ps -ef | grep infrap4d` command.

## Section 2: Running example use case

### Section 2.1: Running example setup with TAP ports.
After logging to container, execute below sample script which will
  - Set the environment.
  - Starts infrap4d process.
  - Creates TAP ports and move to two different namespaces.
  - Create a forwarding pipeline binary.
  - Load the target with forwarding pipeline.
  - Configure rules.
  - Test traffic with Ping between TAP ports.


### Section 2.2: Running example setup ( VM1 <-> IPDK Container <-> VM2 )
Below commands will help you setup traffic between 2 VMs on your host with the
IPDK container as a P4 program enabled vswitch switching traffic between them.

Pre-requisite:
- Container in Section 1 should be up and with Infrap4d running
- If you are running in a VM then make sure you have nested virtualization
  enabled on your guest VM
- QEMU and KVM should be installed and running

### Example description

The demo environment is easily setup. The command below will set the environment up and allow for simple testing using the networking-recipe container:

```
ipdk demo
```

When executed go to the 'Connect to the test VMs serial consoles' paragraph
below.

### Step-by-step commands to setup the example scenario

If you want to execute each command yourself instead of using the pre-written
demo script, do the following steps on your host/server:

1) Create 2 vhost ports using GNMI CTL commands through the `ipdk execute` CLI:

```
ipdk execute --- gnmi-ctl set "device:virtual-device,name:net_vhost0,host-name:host1,device-type:VIRTIO_NET,queues:1,socket-path:/tmp/intf/vhost-user-0,port-type:LINK"

ipdk execute --- gnmi-ctl set "device:virtual-device,name:net_vhost1,host-name:host1,device-type:VIRTIO_NET,queues:1,socket-path:/tmp/intf/vhost-user-1,port-type:LINK"
```

2) On your host, create two Ubuntu demo VM images with accompanying cloud-init images:

```
ipdk createvms
```

3) Those two created VM images can at any moment be started with:

```
ipdk startvms
```

4) Create a forwarding pipeline program by compiling and package the vSwitch consumable
pipeline binary package by using the pipeline builder:

```
export OUTPUT_DIR=/root/examples/simple_l3
ipdk execute --- p4c --arch psa --target dpdk --output $OUTPUT_DIR/pipe --p4runtime-files $OUTPUT_DIR/p4Info.txt --bf-rt-schema $OUTPUT_DIR/bf-rt.json --context $OUTPUT_DIR/pipe/context.json $OUTPUT_DIR/simple_l3.p4

ipdk execute /root/examples/simple_l3 --- tdi_pipeline_builder --p4c_conf_file=simple_l3.conf --bf_pipeline_config_binary_file=simple_l3.pb.bin
```

5) Add the created pipeline binary package to the running IPDK container infrap4d switch:

```
ipdk execute --- p4rt-ctl set-pipe br0 /root/examples/simple_l3/simple_l3.pb.bin /root/examples/simple_l3/p4Info.txt
```

6) Add pipeline table rules:

```
ipdk execute --- p4rt-ctl add-entry br0 ingress.ipv4_host "hdr.ipv4.dst_addr=1.1.1.1,action=ingress.send(0)"

ipdk execute --- p4rt-ctl add-entry br0 ingress.ipv4_host "hdr.ipv4.dst_addr=2.2.2.2,action=ingress.send(1)"
```

From this step you can connect to the test VMs and do some ping tests as described below!

### Connect to the test VMs serial consoles

You will need two login windows, one for each VM:

```
telnet localhost 6551
```

And in another window:

```
telnet localhost 6552
```

You can stop the terminal session anytime by sending `CTRL+]` en then typing `quit[ENTER]`

### Verify guest is finished booting

It may take 6-9 minutes for both guest VMs to finish booting. You can
watch each VM boot over the serial console.

### Ping across VMs

Once you reach the following, you can login as the user `ubuntu` with the
defined password `IPDK`. Then you can ping from vm1 to vm2, and infrap4d will
be used for networking traffic:

```
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~$ telnet localhost 6551
ubuntu@vm1:~$ ping -c 5 2.2.2.2
PING 2.2.2.2 (2.2.2.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

## Section 3: Generating dependent files from P4C and TDI pipeline builder:

TODO: change this whole section to ipdk script + explaining in more depth then demo text above

An open-sourced p4lang P4 compiler is integrated as part of the IPDK container.
1) the p4c executable is used to generate dependent files.
   You can execute all these commands on container.
    a. export OUTPUT_DIR=/root/examples/simple_l3/
    b. p4c --arch psa --target dpdk --output $OUTPUT_DIR/pipe --p4runtime-files \
    $OUTPUT_DIR/p4Info.txt --bf-rt-schema $OUTPUT_DIR/bf-rt.json --context \
    $OUTPUT_DIR/pipe/context.json $OUTPUT_DIR/simple_l3.p4

2) Steps to generate pipeline binary file:
Use tdi_pipeline_builder utility to generate pipeline binary file.
    a. cd /root/examples/simple_l3/
    b. tdi_pipeline_builder --p4c_conf_file=simple_l3.conf \
    --bf_pipeline_config_binary_file=simple_l3.pb.bin

Note: As of today <program>.conf is not generated by compiler, in that case
need to manually update this conf file.

## Using and compiling included P4 Example pipelines
Example P4 pipeline implementations included on the IPDK container:

```
    /root/examples/simple_l3/simple_l3.conf
    /root/examples/simple_l3/simple_l3.p4
```

They can be compiled, put through the pipeline builder and made available on
the host in `~/.ipdk/examples`, by executing:

```
    ipdk [options] examples
```

## Section 4: IPDK CLI inner workings

TODO: Add all specific things about how the IPDK container and cli works.

## [IPDK CLI Configuration settings](#CLI-configuration-settings)

### Configuration files

TODO: Explain how configuration files work (default settings, user settings, execution settings)

### Available settings

TODO: add all configuration options and their working!

KEEP_SOURCE_CODE:

1) If `KEEP_SOURCE_CODE=false` which is a default value then, complete source
code for networking-recipe, p4-driver and P4C will be removed.

2) `KEEP_SOURCE_CODE=true` then, source code for networking-recipe, p4-driver and P4C will
be retained but temporary files generated after building these repositories
will be removed.

DEPLOYMENT_IMAGE:

1) If `DEPLOYMENT_IMAGE=false` which is a default value then,  all libraries
and binaries of modules networking-recipe, p4-driver and P4C are retained without removing
any files generated by the build process.

2) If `DEPLOYMENT_IMAGE=true` then, all libraries and binaries of modules
networking-recipe and p4-driver required for bringing up the stack are retained.

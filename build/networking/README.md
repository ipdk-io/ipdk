# IPDK Build

This directory contains the build instructions and scripts for IPDK. There are
three ways to build and run IPDK:

* [IPDK Container](README_DOCKER.md)
* [IPDK Native](README_NATIVE.md)
* [IPDK Vagrant] (README_VAGRANT.md)

If you are comfortable with Docker and have it installed and working, you
should follow the [IPDK Container](README_DOCKER.md) build instructions.  If
you want to experiment with IPDK running natively in either a VM or on a bare
metal host, you should follow the [IPDK Native](README_NATIVE.md) instructions.
If you want to experiment with IPDK running on a fresh ubuntu 20.04 distribution
then follow the [IPDK Vagrant] (README_VAGRANT.md) build instructions and run
IPDK container or native inside the vagrant box.

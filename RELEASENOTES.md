# IPDK Release Notes

## v22.07

This is the initial release of the Infrastructure Programming Development Kit
(IPDK).  It includes recipes for P4 networking and storage.  As well, it has
support for continuous integration to gate changes to the IPDK repos.

### Recipes

Additions and changes to recipes are detailed here.

#### Storage

In this release initial recipes for storage were added. In particular,
the solution enables:

* Containerized execution environment consisting of 3 storage containers
deployable on different physical systems.
* Exposition of emulated virtio-blk devices to a VM running in a host-target
container from ipu-storage container backed by a remote NVMe-oTCP connection
to a remote storage-target container.
* Dynamic provisioning of up to 64 or more virtio-blk devices to the VM by
hot-(un)plug mechanism.
* Creation of a one-host test environment for integration tests based on
docker-compose including running exemplary fio traffic and dynamic provisioning.
* Customization possibility for enablement of virtio-blk HW-acceleration
through dedicated HW over HW-agnostic interfaces.

#### Networking Recipe (P4-OVS)

##### Feature support

* Linux Networking support(L2 Forwarding,VXLAN,ECMP,Routing,Connection tracking)
* Hotplug support for vhost-user ports
* OpenConfig GNMI CLI support for TAP ports and physical link ports
* Port Configuration dump
* Indirect Counter support
* TDI integration
* PTF support (Python based packet test framework)
* GTEST based Unit test framework
* Action Profile and Action Selector

##### Limitations

* Partial implementation of TCP state machine for connection tracking
* Hotplug feature works with specific configuration and user cannot del/re-add
the hotplug port again <https://github.com/ipdk-io/ovs/issues/38>

### CI/CD

CI has been enabled for the ipdk, ipdk-io.github.io, and ovs repos in this
initial release:

* ipdk - GitHub PR, GitHub Actions ala .github/workflows/* to generate the
  container images and Jenkins CI for the storage recipe
* ipdk-io.github.io - GitHub PR, GitHub Actions ala .github/workflows/* to
  run Jekyll to generate the website
* ovs - GitHub PR, Jenkins CI to do builds/testing

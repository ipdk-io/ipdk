Infrastructure Programmer Development Kit (IPDK) is an open source, vendor
agnostic framework of drivers and APIs for infrastructure offload and
management that runs on a CPU, IPU, DPU or switch. IPDK runs in Linux and uses
a set of well-established tools such as SPDK, DPDK and P4 to enable network
virtualization, storage virtualization, workload provisioning, root-of-trust
and offload capabilities found in the platform. IPDK provides a common platform
for increasing performance, optimizing resources and securing the
infrastructure as an open source community.

## v23.07

### Storage

IPDK Storage was successfully transitioned to OPI. The support of
[SMA API](https://spdk.io/doc/sma.html) was dropped in favor of supporting
[OPI Storage API](https://github.com/opiproject/opi-api/tree/main/storage).
The new location for the storage work are OPI repositories, in particular:

* [opi-spdk-bridge](https://github.com/opiproject/opi-spdk-bridge) for a purely
  SW-based implementation bridging OPI gRPC to SPDK JSON RPCs
* [opi-intel-bridge](https://github.com/opiproject/opi-intel-bridge) for OPI
  gRPC to Intel SDK bridge

The new OPI-aligned solution is Golang-based and provides usage examples as part
of the documentation of the particular repository.

Following features are supported:

* SPDK-target
  * Enabling opi-spdk-bridge extensions
  * Dynamic exposition of virtio-blk or NVMe storage devices to the virtualized
    host
  * Volume-level rate and bandwidth limiters support
  * Enabling crypto for storage data send/retrieved to/from volumes
* Intel IPU-target
  * Dynamic exposition of NVMe storage devices to the host
  * Device-level and volume-level rate and bandwidth limiters for NVMe devices
  * Enabling HW-accelerated crypto for storage data send/retrieved to/from
    volumes
  * Supporting mTLS-secured gRPC communication channel to the IPU

---

**NOTE:**\
The deprecated SMA-based solution was removed from the main branch of IPDK
repository but is still accessible under the
[v23.01 release branch](https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk/tree/ipdk_v23.01/).

#### Limitations

* Some reference P4 files provided are missing a default-action statement.
Depending on your requirements, you should either
drop the packet or send it to an exception port; otherwise, the packet
will be processed as per the IPU's default behavior.
* The networking recipe currently uses a fork of `p4runtime` repository in order
to support mirroring for Intel IPU E2100
* Local mirroring feature: Modification for mirror packet does not work after
first rule
* IPv6 feature:
  * Add a route with remote TEP IPv6 as nexthop

    ```bash
    ip -6 route change <local TEP network address> via <remote TEP address>
    dev <idpf interface name corresponding to phy port 0>
    
    Example: ip -6 route change 1000:1::/64 via 1000:1::2 dev ens802f0d1
    ```

  * Only underlay IPv6 and overlay IPv6 use case are supported. IPv4-in-IPv6 and
  IPv6-in-IPv4 support will be added in future release
  * Configure vsi to vsi_group mapping by FXP SEM register due to missing
  Control Plane Channel (CPCHNL) support. Map the host1_vsi to vsi_group 3 by
  executing the following commands on IMC.
  Note: VSI ID of host1 can be queried using
  `/usr/bin/cli_client --query --verbose --config`

    ```bash
    // SEM_DIRECT_MAP_PGEN_CTRL : 63-bit is set to 1 to initiate operation
    by software
    // (Bit 0 is the vsi id of host1_vsi, in the below example vsi id
    of host1 is 6)
    devmem 0x20292002a0 64 0x8000050000000006

    // SEM_DIRECT_MAP_PGEN_DATA_VSI_GROUP : set the vsi_group to 1
    devmem 0x2029200388 64 0x3

    // SEM_DIRECT_MAP_PGEN_CTRL : bit-63 and bit-61 set to 1 to write the vsig
    value in vsi_group register
    // (Bit 0 is the vsi id of host1_vsi, in this example vsi id of
    host1 is 6)
    devmem 0x20292002a0 64 0xA000050000000006
    ```

  * VXLAN destination port is fixed to be the standard port (4789)
  * ofproto rules that alter FDB learning on OVS are not supported
  * Tagged packets are not supported

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Offload Recipe

The Kubernetes Infrastructure Offload Recipe enhances and extends the
functionality enabled in 23.01 release. In this release, it adds support for
Intel IPU E2100 (ES2K) target in addition to existing P4-DPDK target. This is
the first release that supports both these targets. Following is the list of
features added in this release.

#### For ES2K target

* Support for Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) to deploy pods and
  enable pod-to-pod connectivity on a P4 target using hardware device
  interfaces.
* Use of internal gateway with dummy MAC to enable layer-3 connectivity on the
  same node.
* Support for dynamic Subfunctions on ES2K.
  Subfunction is a lightweight function that has a parent PCI function on which
  it is deployed. It is created and deployed in a unit of 1. Unlike SRIOV VFs,
  a subfunction doesn't require its own PCI virtual function. A subfunction
  communicates with the hardware through the parent PCI function.
* Infra Manager build support on ARM cores.

#### For Both ES2K and DPDK targets

* TLS enablement to authenticate gRPC traffic between Infra Manager and Infra
  Agent and between Infra Manager and underlying ``infrap4d`` (IPDK Networking
  Recipe)
* Makefile target to support tls-secrets and certificate generation
* Automated build & integration test on each commit
* Felix integration and communication with Infrastructure Offload components.
* Addition of DB to store state information.
* Support for Go version 1.20.5
* Support for logging per feature in components
* Configurable MTU using config file

For full list of features, limitations, and other details, refer to [K8s Infra
Offload Recipe Release Notes](https://github.com/ipdk-io/k8s-infra-offload/blob/ipdk_v23.07/docs/ReleaseNotes.md).

## v23.01

### Storage

The storage recipe enhances and extends the functionality enabled in the
22.07 release.
All virtio-blk flows from 22.07 have been enabled for NVMe including fio
traffic, hot-plug and scale-out scenarios.

Additional major features are enabled including:

* Quality-of-Service (QoS) support
  * Device-level rate and bandwidth limiters for virtio-blk devices
  * Volume-level rate and bandwidth limiters for NVMe devices
* Data-At-Rest Encryption (DARE) support for NVMe devices using
  * AES CBC cipher or
  * AES XTS cipher

Minor enhancements for this release include:

* Introduction of the cmd-sender container to improve use-of-use for the user
* Refactor of the object model to allow for more flexible design
* Adding `host-target` customization capability
* Adding the possibility to download pre-build images from GHCR
* Extending the solution with Python-based integration tests
* Passing arguments to SPDK from outside of containers
* Add ability to force build `host-target` container
* Providing fio config and results in JSON format
* Security-related improvements and fixes
* Documentation improvements

---

**NOTE:**\
IPDK is switching to the OPI Storage APIs. As part of that work SMA API will be
deprecated and will not be supported further.
IPDK contributors will work with OPI community to reach feature parity with the
current IPDK solution and plan to complete the full transition to OPI Storage
APIs by 23.07 release to allow for a full validation cycle.

---

### Networking Recipe

#### Feature support

* Re-architecture of the Networking Recipe. The recipe is now modular and
launched as the `infrap4d` process
* Support for underlay traffic hashing with ECMP
* Support for dynamic underlay traffic via FRR, including routes learned with
ECMP
* Flow dump support (including direct counters)
* TLS enablement to authenticate gRPC traffic

#### Limitations

* Linux Networking limitations are summarized here:
<https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe/blob/main/p4src/linux_networking/README_LINUX_NETWORKING.md#limitations>
* Unable to delete OVS bridge using command `ovs-vsctl del-br` while actively
running traffic. User needs to stop all the networking recipe processes to
proceed
with bridge deletion
* Flow dump & counters: A table-id/counter-id=0 is not yet supported
* TLS feature: Custom certificate location is unsupported for P4RT gRPC client.
Certificates are expected in default location (/usr/share/stratum/certs)
* TLS feature: If infrap4d is operating in insecure mode, gRPC clients may fail
connecting
to the server. Move the certificates out of the default location
(/usr/share/stratum/certs/ folder) in order to use insecure communication
between gRPC clients and server

### Kubernetes Networking Infrastructure Offload

* Support for Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) to enable pods to
  send/receive traffic.
* Intra Node L3 Forwarding to enable pod to pod communication, on the same node,
  via CNI interfaces.
* Service Load Balancing within the node to allow multiple pods on same node to
  act as end points providing any application service.
* Bi-directional Auto Learning and Flow Pinning (a.k.a Connection Tracking),
  used with load balancing, to allow consistent end point pod selection, once it
  has been selected for the first packet.
* DNS service provided by Core DNS pods to other pods.
* Support for TLS traffic between DNS server pods and Kube API.

#### K8s Infra Components

The following are the main components of K8s Infra Offload software.

K8s Infra Manager

* The Infra Manager is deployed as a core kube-system pod along with other
  kube-system pods.
* This components acts as a gRPC server for K8s Infra Agent and receives K8s
  configurations from the Infra Agent over the gRPC channel.
* It acts as a client for the P4 Runtime Server (infrap4d) and updates the
  K8s Pipeline tables (Data Plane), over another gRPC channel, to apply K8s
  configurations.

K8s Infra Agent

* The Infra Agent is also deployed as a core kube-system pod along with other
  kube-system pods.
* It receives all CNI requests from the Calico plug-in, configures pod system
  files and adds interaces to be pods. And finally, it relays these
  configurations to the Infra Manager.
* It also acts as a K8s client for K8s API server and receives all configuration
  changes and passes them on to the Infra Manager component.
* It interacts with Infra Manager over gRPC channel to pass all the
  configurations.

K8s P4 Pipeline

* The K8s P4 pipeline is a pre-built component that can be loaded on the P4-DPDK
  dataplane.
* It comes along with the source P4 code for user to understand the packet
  processing pipeline.
* Offloading kube-proxy functionality, providing pod to pod L3 connectivity,
  local node gateway routing, load balancing & connection tracking, is all
  implemented within this pipeline.
* It exposes p4 tables that can be modified at runtime with packet processing
  rules. These rules are for managing pkt forwarding, service groups, service
  end points, etc.

### IPsec Recipe (Design Preview)

In 23.01 the IPsec Recipe is a design preview and includes a StrongSwan plugin
which implements the p4runtime and openconfig clients to configure IPsec SPD
and SAD to the target devices.

* IPsec recipe design preview is validated on Intel IPU target.
* Refer to [https://ipdk.io/documentation/Recipes/InlineIPsec/](https://ipdk.io/documentation/Recipes/InlineIPsec/)
* YANG model for IPsec SAD: [https://github.com/ipdk-io/openconfig-public/blob/master/release/models/ipsec/openconfig-ipsec-offload.yang](https://github.com/ipdk-io/openconfig-public/blob/master/release/models/ipsec/openconfig-ipsec-offload.yang)
* Reference P4 program to enable IPsec on DPDK target: [https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe/tree/main/p4src/Inline_IPsec](https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe/tree/main/p4src/Inline_IPsec)

### CI/CD

CI has been enabled for the ipdk, ipdk-io.github.io, and recipe repos.

## v22.07

This is the initial release of the Infrastructure Programming Development Kit
(IPDK).  It includes recipes for P4 networking and storage.  As well, it has
support for continuous integration to gate changes to the IPDK repos.

### Storage

In this release initial recipes for storage were added. In particular,
the solution enables:

* Containerized execution environment consisting of 3 storage containers
deployable on different physical systems.
* Exposition of emulated virtio-blk devices to a VM running in a host-target
container from ipu-storage container backed by a remote NVMe-oTCP connection
to a remote storage-target container.
* Dynamic provisioning of up to 64 or more virtio-blk devices to the VM by
hot-(un)plug mechanism.
* Creation of a one-host test environment for integration tests based on
docker-compose including running exemplary fio traffic and dynamic provisioning.
* Customization possibility for enablement of virtio-blk HW-acceleration
through dedicated HW over HW-agnostic interfaces.
